Here are the primary data sources you can use to power your SolomonicPrayerClock module‚Äîcategorized by type and reliability. These include both canonical texts, grimoire traditions, and computed astronomical data for planetary hours.

‚∏ª

To calculate planetary hours based on sunrise/sunset at your location:

Source	Use	Format
SunCalc (npm package)	Compute sunrise/sunset locally	JS lib
Timeanddate.com	Reference planetary hours manually	Web
OpenWeatherMap / WeatherAPI	Fallback sunrise/sunset	JSON
AstroJS	Advanced planetary calendars	Optional
Lunisolar.js	Moon phase & Hebrew calendar overlay	Optional

NPM Packages:
	‚Ä¢	suncalc
	‚Ä¢	astronomia

‚∏ª

üìÅ 4. Angel Names, Sigils, and Divine Names

These are traditionally passed down in grimoires, but can be templated for display.

Sigils	Can be generated using Rose Cross, Magic Squares, or from grimoire images
Names of God	Bible, Kabbalistic tradition, Sefer Raziel, Key of Solomon

	‚Ä¢	Sigils can be reproduced as SVGs or PNGs from occult-symbols.com or drawn from public domain PDFs

üìä 5. Wisdom, Wealth, Health, Influence Mapping

You‚Äôll need to map Psalms and Proverbs to your desired focus areas. You can do this manually or with a JSON file like this:

{
  "wisdom": ["Proverbs 1", "Psalm 111:10", "Psalm 119:97"],
  "wealth": ["Psalm 112", "Proverbs 10:22", "Psalm 1"],
  "health": ["Psalm 103:2-5", "Psalm 91", "Proverbs 3:7-8"],
  "influence": ["Psalm 72", "Proverbs 22:29", "Psalm 45"]
}

This JSON file can then be rotated based on hour or day.

‚∏ª

üß† Bonus: AI or LLM Preprocessing (optional)

If you want to score each Psalm for focus area, you can use:
	‚Ä¢	OpenAI or local Ollama with a prompt like:
‚ÄúClassify this Psalm into: Wisdom, Wealth, Health, Influence, or Multiple.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Save results into a local cache or JSON for use in your dashboard

‚∏ª
