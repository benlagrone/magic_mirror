You’re nearly there—but to ensure GPT‑Codex or GitHub Copilot Chat can fully build the module without gaps, I recommend handing off with:

⸻

✅ Minimum Handoff Package

You should provide Codex:
	1.	✅ The solomonic_focus_mapping.json
	2.	✅ The README.md instructions (from earlier)
	3.	✅ These additional instructions:

⸻

📦 Additional Instructions for Codex (README Add-on)

Append this to your README.md so Codex knows what to build:

⸻

🛠️ Build Instructions for Codex
	•	Load solomonic_focus_mapping.json at module startup into memory.
	•	Use it to rotate Psalms/proverbs based on the focusAreas array in config.
	•	Use SunCalc to compute local sunrise/sunset from latitude and longitude in config.
	•	Calculate planetary hours dynamically using sunrise/sunset, assigning planets and angels per hour.
	•	For each hour:
	•	Show current planet, angel, focus area
	•	Pull a verse from focus_mapping[focusArea] list
	•	Add fallback: If planetary hour calc fails, default to 1-hour blocks and hardcoded weekday mapping.

🎨 Display Design
	•	Rotate every 5–10 seconds between:
	1.	Current day info (angel, name of God, planet, Psalm)
	2.	Current planetary hour and verse
	3.	Next hour preview
	•	Include icons or text sigils from /assets/sigils/{angel}.png if showSigils is true.

💡 What Codex Still Needs to Do

✅ You already provided:
	•	Focus area mapping JSON
	•	High-level visual and logic spec

🧠 Codex still needs to:
	•	Implement the planetary hour math (use SunCalc)
	•	Define a static JSON for angels/planets/names per weekday (or let me generate that for you)
	•	Build the MMM-SolomonicPrayerClock.js and node_helper.js
	•	Style it (CSS optional, or minimal for now)

⸻

🚀 Next Option

If you’d like me to:
	•	✅ Generate the planetary hour/angel mapping as JSON
	•	✅ Output a starter version of MMM-SolomonicPrayerClock.js
	•	✅ Zip the whole structure for MagicMirror install

Just say the word: “Continue with build”, and I’ll take you there.
